    "This notebook was instigated by [a xeet posted by Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1760740503614836917). Throughout this notebook, we will attempt to take a longform video and automatedly transform it into a blog post.\n",

    "## Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy for enabling this will evolve over time, but here is what I am thinking as of right now:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe the audio from the video.\n",
    "- Use LLM to break the transcription into logical segments.\n",
    "- Determine the timestamp chunks from the previous step's segmentated script.\n",
    "- Use something (there's gotta be something!) to automatedly break the video into chunks.\n",
    "- Extract frames at regular intervals and save them to disk for later use (This is tough to get right...)\n",
    "- Use LLM to summarize the segmented into an outline **in JSON form**. (Important to get it in a structured form for the next steps.)\n",
    "- In parallel, produce each segment of the blog post by passing in the following info in each parallel call:\n",
    "    - The full outline (Maybe this needs converted back from JSON into plaintext?)\n",
    "    - The transcribed text from that particular section\n",
    "    - GPT-V uses the images to give a better description of what's going on (Again, hard problem)\n",
    "- Run the full blog post back through the LLM for \"final clean up\", ensuring cohesion and proper attributions are moved to the end of the post"
